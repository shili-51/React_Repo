Any data in the parent component passed as props is availbale in the children component. Now if a child component want to communicate with the parent component. 
For this also we use props, but this time we pass in reference to a method as props to a child component.
For example we click on the button in child component, want to execute method in parent component i.e. a child component calls a parent component's method and this is achieved
with the help of props.


Difference is we pass the method itself as a prop to the child component. so that child component can execute method in parent component.

ParentComponent.js
class ParentComponent extends Component {

    constructor(props) {
      super(props)
    
      this.state = {
         parentName : 'Parent'
      }
      this.greetParent = this.greetParent.bind(this)
    }

    greetParent() {
        alert(`Hello ${this.state.parentName}`)
    }
    
  render() {
    return(
        <div>
            {/* passing greetParent method to prop greetHandler */}
            <ChildComponent greetHandler = {this.greetParent}/>            --------------- passing prop to child component
        </div>
    )
  }
}


ChildComponent.js
function ChildComponent(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* <button onClick = {props.greetHandler}>Greet Parent</button> */}
      <button onClick = {() => props.greetHandler('child')}>Greet Parent</button>
    </div>
  )
}
