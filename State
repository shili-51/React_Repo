State

every react component returns jsx which describes user interface.
second way to influence what is rendered on screen is state.
state is managed within the component.
state can be changed.
functional components - useState Hook
class components - this.state 

state is an object that is privately maintained inside a component.
state can influence what is rendered in the browser
state can be changed within the component. 

for declaring state we need to declare a contructor and a super method inside it.
and on clicking any button we can change the state of the object with the help of onCLick event Listener.

We use state as it can be changed with the help of event handlers but props can not be changed.
