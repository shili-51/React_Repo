React is a javascript library. It is an open source library for building user interfaces.
It is not a framework.
React does not focus on routing or other aspects of our web application like HTTP requests.


Components describe a part of the user interface

They are re-usable and can be nested inside other components

There are two types of components :
1)Stateless Functional Components
2)Stateful class Components

Functional Components - are just javascript functions. They can optionally receive an object of properties(props) as input and returns HTML(JSX) as output which describes UI.

Class Components - class components maintain a private internal state that is it can maintain some private information associated to that component and use that information 
to describe user interface.
